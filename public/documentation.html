        <h1>API Documentation Page</h1>
        <p>This is a REST API which interacts with a database storing data about different movies</p>
        <p>
            This API was built to provide the server-side component of a “movies” web application. The web
            application provides users with access to information about different
            movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to sign up, update their
            personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies!
